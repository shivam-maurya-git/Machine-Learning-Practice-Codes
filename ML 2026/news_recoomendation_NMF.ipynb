A figure above 50 signals expansion, while anything below indicates contraction.\"Growth momentum is still insufficient,\" NBS said in a statement. - Investors eye US factory data -On forex markets the dollar extended gains ahead of the release of American factory data due later on Friday and following a steady stream of good news from the world´s biggest economy.The dollar bought 120.44 yen, compared to 119.44 yen in final 2014 trading on Wednesday.Wall Street toasted a banner year in 2014, with US equity markets finishing near all-time highs.The euro meanwhile slipped amid growing expectations that the European Central Bank, which meets on January 22, will start buying sovereign bonds. The single currency bought $1.2061 compared to $1.2160 in pre-holiday trade.The ECB has already used several tools to push inflation in member nations back up to the 2.0 percent annual rate it regards as healthy, including asset purchases and making cheap loans available to banks.It is also examining the possibility of large-scale purchases of sovereign debt -- so-called quantitative easing (QE) -- to help jump-start the European Union´s moribund economy.Oil prices rose on Friday, with US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery rising 44 cents to $54.07 and Brent crude for February gaining 18 cents to $57.51.\"The gains in Asian trading are likely because of the positive US crude stockpiles data released on Wednesday,\" Daniel Ang, investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore, told AFP.US crude reserves fell by 1.8 million barrels in the week to December 26, the US Energy Information Administration said in its last petroleum report for 2014 released on Wednesday, boosting prices that lost nearly half their value in the second half of the year.There is growing speculation that the slide in global oil prices -- the biggest since the financial crisis in 2008 -- may have been excessive.\"If we do see some supply-side responses, or even if they´re anticipated over the course of this first quarter of the year, we might find that oil has in fact bottomed,\" Michael McCarthy, a chief strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told Bloomberg.Gold was at $1,182.36 an ounce, compared with $1,199.00 in end-of-year trading on Wednesday.In other markets:-- Jakarta ended up 0.30 percent, or 15.82 points, at 5,242.77.Coal firm Indo Tambangraya Megah gained 3.41 percent to 15,900 rupiah, while miner Aneka Tambang slipped 1.88 percent to 1,045 rupiah.-- Malaysia´s main stock index shed 0.48 percent, or 8.48 points, to close at 1,752.77.Malayan Banking lost 0.55 percent to 9.12 ringgit, Public Bank slipped 0.44 percent to 18.22 while Top Globe added 1.77 percent 4.60 ringgit.-- Singapore rose 0.16 percent, or 5.44 points, to 3,370.59.Agribusiness company Wilmar International gained 0.93 percent to Sg$3.27 while real estate developer Capitaland dipped 0.30 percent to Sg$3.30.-- Mumbai gained 1.38 percent, or 380.36 points, to end at 27,887.90.Housing Development Finance Corp rose 4.30 percent to 1,171.80 rupees, while Mahindra & Mahindra fell 0.92 percent to 1,224.80 rupees.

      "Hong Kong: A modest recovery in oil prices provided some respite for Asian energy firms Wednesday but stock markets extended losses as China´s ongoing economic woes cast a pall over the region´s trading floors.The cost of the black gold has plunged by almost a tenth since Friday´s refusal by the OPEC oil exporters´ group to agree a ceiling on output despite oversupply and anaemic demand across the globe.The impact of the weak commodity price environment was also made stark Tuesday when US mining giant Anglo American said it would scythe almost two-thirds of its workforce and reduce investment by about $1 billion.On Wednesday US benchmark West Texas Intermediate was up 1.7 percent in the morning while Brent added 1.2 percent.Among regional energy firms BHP Billiton added almost one percent in Sydney, Inpex gained 1.3 percent in Tokyo and Hong Kong-listed CNOOC put on 1.7 percent.However, the oil contracts are still struggling around seven-year lows and analysts said the gloom was likely to last for some time.\"We remain of the view that oil will stay below $50 a barrel into the foreseeable future,\" Evan Lucas, a markets strategist in Melbourne at IG Ltd., told clients according to Bloomberg News.\"The industrial metals and iron-ore thematics are basically facing the same factors that are influencing oil.\"A global supply glut, weak demand and the growth slowdown in China have combined with soaring production to send crude slumping more than 60 percent over the past 18 months.Most Asian markets extended their losses of this week, tracking a downturn on Wall Street where all three main indexes ended in the red.Tokyo was 1.1 percent off by lunch, Hong Kong lost 0.6 percent and Sydney fell 0.3 percent while Taipei, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur were also in negative territory.Shanghai was 0.2 percent down as ongoing worries about China overshadowed data showing November inflation was just above expectations.Consumer prices rose 1.5 percent last month, up from October and better than the forecast in a survey by Bloomberg News but well short of Beijing´s target rate of \"around three percent\".But the November reading remained well below China´s annual target of an increase of \"around three percent\" announced in March.- Key figures around 0300 GMT -Tokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 1.1 percent at 19,281.46 (break)Hong Kong - Hang Seng: DOWN 0.5 percent at 21803.28Euro/dollar: UP to $1.0912 from $1.0892 late TuesdayDollar/yen: DOWN to 122.78 yen from 122.97 yenNew York - Dow: DOWN 0.9 percent at 17,568.00 (close)London - FTSE 100: DOWN 1.4 percent at 6,135.22 points (close)\n",

      "Hong Kong: Asian markets extended their rally this week, while the euro dipped ahead of a much-anticipated European Central Bank policy meeting that is forecast to see it introduce more monetary easing measures.Tokyo added 0.28 percent, or 48.54 points, to end at 17,329.02, Sydney rose 0.49 percent, or 26.56 points, to 5,419.94 and Seoul was flat, dipping a marginal 0.41 points to 1,920.82.Hong Kong rose 0.70 percent, or 170.05 points, to 24,522.63 and Shanghai gained 0.59 percent, or 19.73 points, to 3,343.34. The mainland China index has recovered almost all the losses it made on Monday in reaction to a regulatory crackdown on margin trading.Eyes are firmly on the ECB meeting later Thursday, with expectations high that it will unveil a programme of asset-purchasing, or quantitative easing (QE).Speculation has been rife for several months that more stimulus would be announced as inflation continues to weaken -- prices in the euro area fell in December for the first time in five years.According to analysts at UniCredit, the market is expecting the ECB to unveil a programme worth between 500 and 800 billion euros ($580 to $930 billion).Wall Street took its rally into a third day Wednesday, the Dow ending up 0.22 percent, the S&P 500 adding 0.47 percent and the Nasdaq 0.27 percent higher.With traders placing bets on a vast round of easing the euro has been hammered in the past few weeks, especially as it comes just a few months after the US Federal Reserve wound up its own QE programme and considers an interest rate hike this year.At one point last week the single currency fell below $1.1500 for the first time since late 2003.In afternoon trade Thursday it bought $1.1624 and 136.78 yen compared with $1.1607 and 136.85 yen in US trade.\"The euro decision is kind of well telegraphed but euro-dollar does have more to go on the downside,\" Thomas Averill, a managing director in Sydney at Rochford Capital, told Bloomberg News. \"The eurozone economy seems pretty sluggish at the moment and needs QE.\"The dollar was 117.66 yen against 117.90 yen in New York.Oil prices were largely flat after enjoying a rare fillip Wednesday. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for March delivery rose just 10 cents to $47.88 and Brent rose 42 cents to $49.45.On Wednesday WTI jumped $1.31 and Brent climbed $1.04.Gold fetched $1,286.66 an ounce, against $1,300.64 late Wednesday.In other markets:-- Kuala Lumpur rose 0.66 percent, or 11.66 points, to 1,781.75.Public Bank rose 0.56 percent to 17.84 ringgit, RHB Capital gained 0.13 percent to 7.73 while Malayan Banking was flat at 8.87 ringgit.-- Jakarta rose 0.73 percent, or 37.92 points, to 5,253.18.State miner Aneka Tambang rose 0.48 percent to 1,055 rupiah while palm oil producer Astra Agro Lestari fell 0.72 percent to 24,000 rupiah.-- Singapore rose 0.47 percent, or 15.83 points, to 3,370.29.Real estate developer Capitaland gained 0.59 percent to Sg$3.42 while United Overseas Bank rose 0.64 percent to Sg$23.50.-- Mumbai rose 0.41 percent, or 117.16 points, to end at 29,006.02 points.Sun Pharmaceutical Industries rose 3.85 percent to 920.05 rupees, while National Thermal Power Corporation fell 2.30 percent to 140.20 rupees.-- Bangkok rose 1.49 percent, or 22.98 points, to 1,560.34.Bank of Ayudhya soared 8.98 percent to 69.75 baht, while Thai Oil climbed 7.22 percent to 48.25 baht.-- Taipei rose 0.53 percent, or 49.80 points, to 9,369.51.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. fell 0.71 percent to Tw$140.0 while Acer ticked up 0.74 percent to Tw$20.45.-- Wellington slipped 0.45 percent, or 25.71 points, to 5,647.14.Spark fell 1.83 percent to NZ$3.215 while Fletcher Building was down 1.78 percent at NZ$8.27.-- Manila fell 0.77 percent, or 57.79 points, to 7,416.31.JG Summit Holdings plunged 11.16 percent to 62.10 pesos, Metropolitan Bank dropped 2.86 percent to 90.00 pesos and Ayala Land ended 0.29 percent down at 34.85 pesos.

      "Hong Kong: Asian stocks recovered slightly Wednesday from a mass sell-off in the previous session, with emerging currencies ending a tough quarter on a high but analysts warned of further volatility ahead.Mining giant Glencore almost halved Tuesday´s 30 percent losses after it moved to reassure investors its business remained robust, following rumours in financial circles it might soon be delisted as it is buffeted by weak commodity prices and China´s slowdown.The next focus point is on a speech due to be given by Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen later in the day, with hopes she will shed more light on the bank´s plans for raising US interest rates.Regional equities and risk assets went into a sharp reverse Tuesday, tracking a slump in New York and Europe after another batch of disappointing Chinese data fanned fresh fears about the world´s number two economy.But buying picked up on Wednesday, the last day of a torrid quarter that has seen trillions wiped off global valuations, sparked by Beijing´s shock devaluation of its yuan currency last month. Traders were given a mostly positive lead from Wall Street, while the Dow and S&P 500 edged up.Hong Kong-listed shares of Glencore, which has been hammered by soft resources demand in China that led brokerage Investec to question its future if prices did not improve, were the stand-out winner as it rallied after Tuesday´s crash.The firm rose 15 percent in early trade after the debt-laden Swiss company insisted its business was \"operationally and financially robust\".\"We have positive cash flow, good liquidity and absolutely no solvency issues,\" it said in a statement.The firm´s London-listed stock ended up 16.95 percent Tuesday, recovering a good part of the 29-percent loss it suffered the previous day.In Asian trade Wednesday Tokyo rose 1.87 percent by the break, Hong Kong added 0.80 percent, Sydney was 0.98 percent higher and Shanghai put on 0.72 percent.

      "HONG KONG: Asian stocks sank deeper into crisis Monday, with Shanghai posting its largest intra-day fall since 2007 as growing concerns about China´s slowing economy rattled equity investors worldwide. Oil prices fell further after slipping below $40 a barrel for the first time in six years, as weak Chinese manufacturing data deepened worries about the slowdown in the world´s number two economy.China-linked shares led the falls, with Shanghai losing more than 8.50 percent at one point before recovering slightly to a 7.52 percent decline in afternoon trading -- wiping out all this year´s gains. Hong Kong was down 4.77 percent.Tokyo closed down 4.61 percent, or 895.15 points, at a six-month low of 18,540.68. Seoul dropped 2.47 percent or 46.26 points to 1,829.81 and Sydney lost 4.09 percent, or 213.3 points, to finish at a two-year low of 5,001.3.Regional shares, as measured by the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, slumped to a two-year low Monday after suffering the worst week for three years. Taipei posted its worst ever intra-day slump of almost 7.50 percent.\"Today has all the hallmarks of being one of the worst trading days of the past five years,\" said Evan Lucas at IG Markets.\"The reaction from Asia today will be symptomatic of the current investor sentiment and belief that a hard landing (of China´s economy) is inevitable.\"Asia´s losses followed a steep fall in US and European stocks on Friday, while the price of several commodities plunged to multi-year lows and emerging market currencies took a battering. Global equities have lost more than $5 trillion in value since China´s shock currency devaluation on August 11 sparked fears its economy is slowing more than thought. Data on Friday showing Chinese manufacturing activity slowed to a 77-month low added to the gloom, signalling that even a campaign by Beijing to stimulate growth by cutting interest rates and boosting lending is not working. Pension fund buying equitiesMore than 750 stocks listed in Shanghai fell by their maximum 10 percent daily limit on Monday, among them many of the brokerages which helped to spark a year-long rally that saw shares soar 150 percent before they collapsed in June. Chinese authorities have since launched unprecedented measures to support shares. On Sunday state media said the huge national pension fund would now be allowed to buy equities, in a fresh bid to prop up the market. The fund, which had some 3.5 trillion yuan ($550 billion) in net assets at the end of 2014, will be able to invest up to 30 percent of that in equities.But local investors fear even Beijing´s huge firepower will not be enough to stop the rout in Chinese shares, particularly after Shanghai shares fell through the key 3,500 point mark.\"This is a real disaster and it seems nothing can stop it,\" Chen Gang, Shanghai-based chief investment officer at Heqitongyi Asset Management Co., told Bloomberg News.\"If we don´t cut holdings ourselves, the fund (managed by his firm) faces risk of forced closure. Many newly started private funds suffered that recently. I hope we can survive.\"Oil prices also fell, after breaking below the $40 barrel for the first time in six years Friday on concerns about waning demand in China, the world´s top energy importer.Data showing the number of US drilling rigs rose last week, despite the slump in prices, added to concerns a global supply glut will last for years.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for October delivery fell $1.28 to $39.58 while Brent crude for October eased $1.45 to $44.65.Jitters over China and the global economy saw traders drop the dollar and move into the yen -- a safe haven in times of turmoil and uncertainty -- while the currencies of Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea all hit fresh multi-year lows.The greenback fell to 121.23 yen in Asia Monday, down from 122.06 yen in New York Friday. The euro was at $1.1425 and 138.51 yen, from $1.1386 and 138.97 yen.Gold traded at $1,153.24 compared to $1,154.45 late Friday.In other markets:-- Taipei closed down 4.84 percent, or 376.58 points, at 7,410.34 after posting their biggest ever intra-day decline of 7.49 percent.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co lost 4.96 percent to Tw$115.0 while Hon Hai Precision closed 4.56 percent lower at Tw$81.6.-- Wellington dropped 2.50 percent or 143.87 points to an eight-month low of 5,607.32.Heavyweight Fletcher Building was among the biggest losers, down 3.98 percent at NZ$7.23, while Air New Zealand slipped 0.93 percent to NZ$2.67.                        \n",
